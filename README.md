# Othello_AI

## Overview
This Othello_AI project showcases an Artificial Intelligence designed for the classic board game Othello. It leverages the Min-Max Algorithm to strategize moves against human players or other AIs. The project is implemented in Java and Processing, offering a solid backend coupled with an engaging front-end interface.

## Features
- **Min-Max Algorithm**: Employs this algorithm for calculating optimal moves by evaluating different game outcomes.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can enjoy an intuitive gameplay experience.
- **Adaptive AI Opponent**: Engage with an AI that dynamically adjusts its strategy as the game evolves.

## How to Play
1. **Installation**: Clone this repository and ensure Java and Processing are installed.
2. **Starting the Game**: Execute the main application file to launch the game.
3. **Gameplay**: Choose to play against the AI or observe an AI vs. AI match.
4. **Making Moves**: Interact with the game board via the user interface to place discs.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For core game logic and AI algorithm implementation.
- **Processing**: To create the graphical user interface.
